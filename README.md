## Bixby.js

Bixby.js is a framework for building applications using [service-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).

The framework provides components for building applications that consist of
multiple discrete services, which communicate with each other over network-based
protocols or APIs.  Components implement support for commonly-needed
functionality including [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery),
[messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-oriented_middleware), workload
identity, and security.
